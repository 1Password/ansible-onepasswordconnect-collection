The 1Password Connect collection contains modules that interact with your 1Password Connect deployment. The modules communicate with the 1Password Connect API to support Vault Item create/read/update/delete operations.

## ‚ú® Get started

### üöÄ Quickstart
1. You can install the Ansible collection from [Ansible Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/onepassword/connect):

```
ansible-galaxy collection install onepassword.connect
```

2. Get information about an Item, including fields and metadata: 


**Example of finding an Item by Name**
```yaml
--- 
  hosts: localhost
  vars:
    connect_token: "valid.jwt.here"
  environment:
    OP_CONNECT_HOST: http://localhost:8001
  collections:
    - onepassword.connect
  tasks:
    - name: Find the item with the label "Staging Database" in the vault "Staging Env"
      item_info:
        token: "{{ connect_token }}"
        item: Staging Database
        vault: Staging Env
      no_log: true
