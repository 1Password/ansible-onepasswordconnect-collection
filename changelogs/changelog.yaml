        field named ``password``, Ansible raises an error. (https://github.com/1Password/ansible-onepasswordconnect-collection/issues/20)'
      - 'generic_item - if an item of ``type: login`` has multiple ``string`` fields
        named ``username``, Ansible raises an error. (https://github.com/1Password/ansible-onepasswordconnect-collection/issues/20)'

        updating an item. (https://github.com/1Password/ansible-onepasswordconnect-collection/pull/27)
